#How to Contribute
first off, you will need Unity3D. If you don't have it, you can get for free <a href="https://unity3d.com/">here</a>

Next, clone the Repository if you have not already done so.

Open unity and select the project from wherever you cloned it to.

Go to files > Build Settings. You can do files > Build-and-Run if you want to test/play the game.

Once you've built it, there should be a "Build" folder in the project root, open that to find the .exe, the player.dll and the data folder. the exe needs to be in the same folder as those other things to run.
